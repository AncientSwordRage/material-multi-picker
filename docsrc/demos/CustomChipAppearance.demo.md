The chip elements that represent selected items allow the following customisations:
 * with the `itemToLabel` prop, you can override the default chip labels (which are obtained using `itemToString`)
 * with the `chipColor` prop, you can specify a theme color to use
 * with the `itemToAvatar` prop, you can use [Material Avatars](https://material-ui.com/demos/avatars/) to display per-item icons
 * with the `itemToPopover` prop, you can provide per-item popover helpers that activate when the user hovers over the chip
