const things = [
    "raindrops on roses", "whiskers on kittens", "bright copper kettles", "warm woolen mittens"
]

function getSuggestions(inputValue) {
    return things.filter(thing => thing.includes(inputValue));
}

function MyPicker({ items, onItemsChange }) {
    return (
        <MultiPicker
            value={ items }
            onChange={ onItemsChange }
            getSuggestedItems={ getSuggestions }
            itemToString={ item => item }
        />
    );
}
```

## Demo/Sandbox

## Props

| Prop name | Type | Required? | Description |
| --------- | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| `value`   | array | yes | The items currently displayed as "selected" in the picker. They will appear as a series of "pills". |
| `onChange` | function(newValue) | yes | Callback fired by the componnent when the user changes the selected items. |
| `getSuggestedItems` | function(inputValue, selectedItems) | yes | Used by the picker to get the suggestions that will appear in the dropdown. Return an array of items or a promise that resolves to an array of items. |
| `itemToString` | function(item) | yes | Used by the picker to extract a unique identifer string for an item (must return a string). |
| `itemToLabel` | function(item) | no | Used by the picker to populate the pill labels. If not supplied, the results of `itemToString` will be used. |
| `itemToAvatar` | function(item) | no | Used by the picker to add material `<Avatar />` icons into the pills. If not supplied, pills will have no icon. |
| `fullWidth` | boolean | no | As in Material UI, determines whether the picker will grow to fill available horizontal space. Defaults to `false` |
| `label` | string | no | The label applied to the input field. Defaults to `""`. |
| `fetchDelay` | number | no | The delay between the last keypress and the picker fetching suggestions. Useful to avoid spamming a service! Defaults to `0`. |
| `SuggestionComponent` | React component | no | Custom component used to render suggestions in the picker dropdown (see below for a list of supplied props). Defaults to the result of `itemToString`. |

## SuggestionComponent props
When supplying a custom `SuggestionComponent`, you will have access to the following props:

| Prop name | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `itemId` | string | The unique ID of the item (from `itemToString`) |
| `item` | any | The suggestion generated by your `getSuggestedItems` function |
| `isHighlighted` | boolean | `true` if the user is currently highlighting this suggestion (either with keyboard navigation, or by hovering over with the mouse) |
| `inputValue` | string | The string currently entered in the text input field. Useful for highlighting portions of text to indicate matches. |
| `isSelected` | boolean | `true` if the suggestion is already selected in the picker

It's a good idea to avoid interactive or clickable elements in your component, as they may interfere with the picker's event handling.
